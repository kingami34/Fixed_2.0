# Problem Solver

The thing I did was to remove (lu) & (li).

Then created all (div)s around header links easy access

Also arranged href links in-order to coincide with the rest of the page.

.css updates

#1 added display flex to .header

#2 added outline border 

#3 changed padding in several locations
